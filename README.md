# Customer Churn Analysis & Retention Strategy

A comprehensive analysis of telecommunications customer data to identify key churn drivers and inform strategic decision-making. This project was developed in Power BI to provide an interactive and insightful dashboard for stakeholders.

## üìä Project Overview

This project dissects a complex dataset to tell the story of why customers are leaving. The analysis reveals that churn is not random; it is driven by specific, identifiable factors. The primary conclusion is that **competitor pressure** and **contract type** are the two biggest levers that influence customer loyalty.

By transforming raw data into actionable insights, this report provides a clear path for the business to reduce churn, improve customer satisfaction, and protect revenue.

## üìà Key Findings & Visualizations

The data reveals a clear profile of the at-risk customer and the primary triggers for their departure.

### Finding 1: The Competitor Threat is the #1 Cause of Churn

Customers are most frequently lost to rival companies offering more attractive deals.

* **Top Churn Category**: **Competitor** actions account for **44.82%** of all churned customers.
* **Specific Reasons**: The leading specific reasons for leaving are a **"better offer"** and **"better devices"** from a competitor.

### Finding 2: Month-to-Month Contracts Drive High Churn

Contract flexibility comes at the cost of loyalty. Customers without a long-term commitment are significantly more likely to leave.

* **Highest Risk Group**: Customers on **Month-to-Month** plans account for **51.01%** of all churned customers.
* **Loyalty by Contract**: Two-year and one-year contract holders have a much higher retention rate compared to their month-to-month counterparts.

### Finding 3: Seniors Are More Likely to Leave

Seniors have a higher churn rate, and the payment method of a paycheck might also be related to senior groups.

### Finding 4: The Longer They Stay, the More Likely They Are to Stay

Customer tenure is a strong indicator of loyalty. The churn rate consistently decreases as the customer's time with the company increases. This is especially true for customers who make it past the initial volatile months.

### Finding 5: CA Has The Highest Churn Rate

CA state has the highest churn rate, which indicates that more sophisticated research is needed.

### Finding 6: The More Service Calls A Customer Made, Is More Likely to Leave

The number of service calls is highly positively related to the high churn rate

### Finding 7: Unlimited Plan Users of Low Data Usage Have Much Higher Churn Rate

Unlimited plan users with less than 5 GB data usage have a much higher churn rate than users not enrolled in the unlimited plan.

## üí° Strategic Recommendations

Based on these findings, the following actions are recommended to reduce customer churn:

#### üéØ 1. Implement a Proactive Competitor Response Strategy
* **Challenge**: Customers are being actively poached by competitors' offers.
* **Recommendation**: Launch a targeted retention campaign aimed at high-risk customers (e.g., month-to-month customers with 3-6 months of tenure). Equip support teams with pre-approved "loyalty offers" to counter competitor deals in real-time.

#### ü§ù 2. Incentivize Long-Term Commitment
* **Challenge**: The month-to-month contract structure creates a revolving door of customers.
* **Recommendation**: Develop an incentive program to encourage customers to switch from monthly plans to one-year or two-year contracts. This could include a small monthly discount, a one-time service credit, or a free device upgrade.

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è 3. Enhance the Customer Service Experience
* [cite_start]**Challenge**: The attitude of support staff is a significant driver of churn.
* **Recommendation**: Invest in advanced training for customer support teams, focusing on de-escalation, empathy, and proactive problem-solving. [cite_start]Monitor "Avg Customer Service Calls" by state to identify regions that may require additional support[cite: 472].
