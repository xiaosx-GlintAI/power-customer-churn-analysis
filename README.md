# Customer Churn Analysis & Prevention Strategy

### A Deep Dive into Why Customers Leave and How to Make Them Stay

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of telecommunications customers to uncover the primary drivers of churn. The goal was to move beyond high-level metrics and create a data-driven narrative that would empower the business to take targeted, effective action.

The analysis reveals that **competitor activity is the single largest cause of churn**, responsible for nearly 45% of all customer losses. This issue is most acute among customers on **flexible month-to-month contracts**, who represent over 50% of the churned population. The findings from this report form the basis for a series of strategic recommendations aimed at increasing customer loyalty and retention.

## üìà Key Findings & Visualizations

The story of churn is told through several key data visualizations that pinpoint exactly who is leaving, why they are leaving, and when.

### Finding 1: The Competitor Threat is Paramount

Customers are most frequently lost not to general dissatisfaction, but to specific, compelling offers from rival companies.

* **Why they leave:** The top churn category is **Competitor**, accounting for **44.82%** of churned customers.
* **What they offer:** The most cited reasons for switching are a **"better offer"** and **"better devices"** from a competitor, indicating that our value proposition is being successfully challenged in the market.

### Finding 2: Contract Type Dictates Loyalty

The structure of a customer's contract is the most powerful predictor of their loyalty. The lack of a long-term commitment directly correlates with a higher risk of churn.

* **Who is leaving:** **Month-to-Month** customers are the most vulnerable group, making up **51.01%** of all churn.
* **The power of tenure:** Churn rate shows a strong, consistent **downward trend as account length increases**. Customers who remain past the initial high-risk months on flexible plans become progressively more loyal.

### Finding 3: How Customers Pay Matters

Behavioral patterns, such as payment method, also provide clues about a customer's level of engagement and their propensity to churn.

* **High-risk behavior:** Customers who pay via **Paper Check** exhibit a significantly higher churn rate than those using automated methods like Direct Debit or Credit Card. This manual process may correlate with a weaker customer relationship.

## üí° Actionable Recommendations

Based on these insights, the following strategic recommendations can be implemented to directly address the primary drivers of churn:

    * Monitor competitor promotions and empower the support team to proactively offer counter-deals to at-risk customers.

#### ü§ù 2. Incentivize Commitment

* **Strategy:** Reduce the churn rate of the high-risk month-to-month segment by converting them to long-term contracts.
* **Tactics:**
    * Offer a **one-time bonus or a small monthly discount** for switching from a monthly to a one-year or two-year plan.
    * Focus marketing efforts on the **long-term value and stability** of yearly contracts over the perceived flexibility of monthly plans.
